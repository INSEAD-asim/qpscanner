qpScanner v0.5.1



INSTALLATION
============
	
Extract all files to a directory in your webroot, then access in a browser.

Everything required is contained within the zip file, and no mappings nor
datasources need to be setup. 




USAGE
=====

After launching QueryParam Scanner, you should see a simple form to fill in.

	Starting Directory
		Where you put the location of the project(s) you wish to scan.
		This can be either an absolute path or a mapping.
	
	Recursive
		Indicates if you want qpScanner to look inside directories, or remain 
		at the current directory level. 


Once these are set as appropriate, press Scan and qpScanner will get to work.

As it finds queries with CF variables (ie: #values_in_hashes#) that are not 
inside a <cfqueryparam/> tag, it will list that file. The positions of the
queries are displayed when clicking on a file, and clicking on each of those
reveals the actual contents of the query.

When complete, it will list how many were found out of how many total queries.



NOTE: QueryParam Scanner should be used *only* in your development environment, 
not on a live/public box. In addition to the security risks, it might have an 
adverse affect on performance.
